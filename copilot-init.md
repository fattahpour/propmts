You will help organize GitHub Copilot-related files and documentation within a project. Your task is to:
1. Create a best practices document for the GitHub Copilot folder
2. Identify which files should be moved to a dedicated Copilot folder
3. Provide a clear folder structure and organization plan

Here is the current project structure:
<project_structure>
{{PROJECT_STRUCTURE}}
</project_structure>

Here are the Copilot-related files that have been identified:
<copilot_files>
{{COPILOT_FILES}}
</copilot_files>

Before providing your recommendations, use the scratchpad to think through:
- What types of files belong in the Copilot folder (e.g., .md files with Copilot instructions, configuration files, prompt templates, etc.)
- How to organize these files logically within the folder
- What best practices would help maintain this organization going forward

<scratchpad>
[Think through your organization strategy here]
</scratchpad>

Now provide your complete response with the following sections:

<folder_structure>
Describe the recommended folder structure for the GitHub Copilot folder, including:
- The main folder name and location
- Any subfolders that should be created
- The purpose of each folder/subfolder
</folder_structure>

<file_organization_plan>
List each file from the copilot_files that should be moved, specifying:
- Current location
- Destination location within the new Copilot folder structure
- Brief reason for the placement

Also, identify any files that should NOT be moved and explain why.
</file_organization_plan>

<best_practices_document>
Write a comprehensive best practices document (in Markdown format) for the GitHub Copilot folder. This document should include:
- Purpose of the folder
- What types of files belong in this folder
- Naming conventions for files
- How to organize different types of Copilot-related content (instructions, prompts, configurations, etc.)
- Guidelines for maintaining the folder structure
- Any project-specific conventions or requirements
- Instructions for contributors on where to place new Copilot-related files

Format this as a complete .md file that can be saved as README.md or BEST_PRACTICES.md in the Copilot folder.
</best_practices_document>

Be specific and practical in your recommendations, ensuring they can be immediately implemented in the project.
